                    app rather than fold the features within their existing mobile banking app, to Wells Fargo, it’s a segmentation
                    strategy. Would this also be the case with Capital One?</li>

                <p>Based on findings, we can narrow the age range of our target audience from “millennials” to individuals in their 20s.
                Interest in financial aggregation platforms peak during college (because of being newly independent / loan payments) and
                tapers off early to mid 30s, oftentimes when individuals have complex family finances with non-fixed cash flow.</p>

                    mission and positioning to offer perspective into the company’s values. While Capital One’s goals does center around

        <h5>Competitor App Audit</h5>
        <p>A competitive analysis was a great starting point for understanding the feature components of each competitor, but as a visual person, it simply was not enough for me to understand the full scope of how each feature is integrated, what opportunities there are for improvement, and considerations of “best design practices” so, I did an app audit of several competitors. I noted design patterns, important feature components, and flow of screens which ultimately served as inspiration when I later designed the architecture and for “MoneyWise.”.</p>

        <h5>Reviewing Capital One’s Current App</h5>
        <p>Conflicted as where to incorporate "Money Wise" within the pre-established app. Via app audit of Capital One's mobile interface, we identified 4 areas of potential feature incorporation that fit rather seamlessly within the current flow - subtle enough for existing users but also discernible enough for our new millennial audience.

    <div class="container">
        <h5>Sitemap + User Flows</h5>
        <p>With features set in place, we mapped the architecture. Highlighting two distinct paths, I wanted to understand how users would navigate through the app with the goal of 1.
        categorizing and rating transaction, and 2. creating budget and savings goals. A user flow helped to capture multiple
        user paths and decisions points in completing these 2 tasks. It also informs all the screen states that we would need to
        design.</p>

    <div class="container my-5">
        <h1>Interface and Interaction Design</h1>
        <h5>Sketches + Mockups</h5>
        <p>We then fleshed out the layout via iterative rounds of low level sketches before moving forward with the time-consuming high level prototype.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>My focus was on adding a new feature to an existing app, not reinventing the existing app. To that end, I
            adopted all of Capital One's existing UI design principles and styles, choosing to move directly from
            sketches to high fidelity, and relocating more effort into seamless interaction design.</p>

                <p>I created a working high fidelity prototype of the designed screens using MarvelApp. The task flows observed in the
                    prototype are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Task #1:</strong> Find the coffee purchase that you’ve made just now, categorize it, and rate it as a purchase that you “want.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Task #2:</strong> After categorizing and rating, from your current screen, find and view “spending trends: by needs and wants.” Then view your spending breakdown(s) for the month of April.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task #3:</strong> Locate all of your budget goals. You’ve completed your goal for “car” and now want to delete this budget. How would you go about doing so?</li>
                    <li><strong>Task #4: </strong> From your current screen, locate and view all your savings goals. After viewing your savings goals, you decide that you eventually want to go on vacation (sometime around May). Add a $1000 savings goals for vacation and allow for auto-savings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task #5:</strong> Now that you have all your budgets and savings goals in check, you want to view all the alerts that you have for your spending. How would you go about doing that?</li>
                </ul>

        <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
        <p>Ensuring seamless flow and architecture via 5 in-person usability tests. Findings were distilled into 3 categories: test completion and error rates, observations and user comments, as well as overall findings. The design proved to be overall intuitive, with just a few kinks to be smoothed down during my second design iteration.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-6">
                <h5>Test Completion And Error Rates</h5>
                <p>Distillation of usability testing results show that overall, the feature was learn-able and intuitive, with everyone
                    completing all 5 tasks in under a few minutes. Errors were minor: While 1 user had an error with task 3 (locating
                    budget
                    and savings goals had the most error) he was still able to complete the task with relative ease.</p>

                    show
                    us that users prefer to view and categorize transactions via the pre-existing checking account screen versus
                    MoneyWise
                    because it aligns with prior expectations. This is counter to the viewing of trends, budgeting goals, and savings
                    goals,
                    in which all 3 tasks were completed via preferred flows within the MoneyWise feature.</p>

                    didn’t exist with their current banking app. The wants versus needs feature was by far the most successful: 3 out of
                    5
                    users who were impressed how unique and useful it was. Users also expressed positivism with the app’s visual

        <h5>Takeaways & Next Steps</h5>
        <p>Overall, the feature successfully aided users in being mindful of spending (through transaction categorization), and in
        creating an experience that offered the opportunity to create goals / savings when financial situations turn rather
        complicated. But while validation proved our initial design to be fairly successful, it is by no means a final design.
        There is definitely room for improvement. Our next stages should consist of the following:
        Further testing should be conducted to determine the direction to take in regards to the organization of savings and
        budgeting goals.
        Now that we have identified the preferred user flow for categorizing and rating purchases, our second round of iteration
        should focus on how we can make these actions even easier for users.
        Further testing needs to be conducted to see if the lack of usage of some elements (Eg. “uncategorized link”) are due to
        hesitancy in using new features or whether this is a feature that users deem useless.</p>
