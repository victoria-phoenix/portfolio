                    <p>3 major market research insights critical to the scope of this project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insight #1: Millennial habits are driving financial innovation Big banks are likely to be facing increasing pressure not
                        just from upstart companies, but large, well-recognized brands (Amazon, Apple and Google) — to offer a comprehensive
                        suite of financial services.</li>
                        <li>Insight #2: Huge changes in the financial landscape Many banks are building automated savings, budgeting and management
                        capabilities into their existing mobile experiences. Chase recently launched Finn, a mobile banking app with personal
                        finance features folded in, and Wells Fargo will soon launch Greenhouse, a similar concept. 3rd party options like Mint
                        are needing to re-think about their strategies to compete.</li>
                        <li>Insight #3: There's lots of competition

                        offered by these companies in personal finance and money management are:</li>
                    </ul>
                </h3>

                <p>Research uncovers around 14 top players within the finance management space. Major key functionalities and services
                offered by these companies in personal finance and money management are:
                
                Income and spending analysis, including cash flow
                Budget and goal setting
                Financial account aggregation
                Invest Tech portfolio
                Financial advice</p>
                
                <h3>discovery takeaways</h3>
                <p>From these aforementioned insights, it is clear that Capital One needs to focus on improving its app
                experience for millennials. Effectively the first generation to grow up with nearly unlimited access to information, and
                a group that now comprises roughly 25 percent of the U.S. population
                
                While aforementioned insights clarified some initial questions, from it also birthed a second round of inquisitiveness:
                2. What functionalities and services should Capital One offer? We know that the money management market is offering a
                variety of functionalities and services, but there is simply not enough information to determine which of these features
                should be integrated and which of these features Capital One's users would like to have.
                
                1. Would a standalone app be a better option? When asked why Wells Fargo decided to create a new mobile banking app
                rather than fold the features
                within their existing mobile banking app, to Wells Fargo, it’s a segmentation strategy.
            Steve Ellis, head of innovation at Wells Fargo, said <quote>the company decided to build a standalone app so that it
                could focus solely on the needs of the
                targeted customers. If it built the functionality within the existing Wells Fargo app, the target audience would be
                burdened with features that were not applicable to them.</quote>
            
            Would this also be the case with Capital One? 5 finalists to
            conduct a competitive analysis on: 3 direct mobile first banking options with finance management features integrated
            within, and 2 indirect independent fin-tech apps.

            <div id="Information architecture">
                <h3>informaiton arhitecture</h3>
                <p>
                    As a visual person, it simply was not enough for me to understand the
                    full scope of how each feature is integrated, what opportunities there are for improvement, and considerations of “best
                    design practices” so, I did an app audit of all competitors. I noted design patterns, important feature components, and
                    flow of screens. All this would be naught if I did not also audit Capital One’s mobile app, wherein we quickly
                    discovered 4 possible areas that may be subtle for enough for existing users but also discernible enough for our new
                    millennial audience.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="user-research">
                <h3>user research</h3>
                <p>
                A rough preliminary profile of “what I knew thus far about my users” ultimately informed the
                interview recruitment process. I successfully sought out a total of 7 users that aligned to my proto-persona: 3 male, 4
                female, all millennials (between ages 22–37). An extraction of 4 points of tension to help inform my persona’s
                motivations, needs, and idiosyncrasies related to their usage of personal finance management tools. 
                </p>

                <h3>Discovery Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>
                        Millennials are hesitant in using financial management apps because of: 1. Concern about 3rd party information security
                        2. Inaccurate syncing of data / frustrating account setup 3.Time consuming processes Desk Research Confirmations:
                        Interview findings confirm preference to manage finances via mobile app over both online and in-person. 1 user wanted
                        investment features within a banking app, however, 4 deemed it unnecessary. In the case of this project, we will abide
                        with the majority. Users are indeed skeptical about the agenda of large banking institutions. 01. Refinement of our
                        target audience: Based on findings, we can narrow the age range of our target audience from “millennials” to individuals
                        in their 20s. Interest in financial aggregation platforms peak during college (because of being newly independent / loan
                        payments) and tapers off early to mid 30s, oftentimes when individuals have complex family finances with non-fixed cash
                        flow. 03. Strong desire for personal finance management tools within banking apps: 3 of 3 pain points could be resolved
                        by integrating finance management features within a user’s primary banking app that already fulfills most of their
                        financial needs.

            <div id="definingideation">
                <h3>Defining And Ideation</h3>
                <p>Tossing around ideas ranging in scope, size, and feasibility.In lieu of speaking
                directly with the Capital One team, I relied on their brand mission and positioning to offer perspective into the
                company's values. While Capital One’s goals does center around monetizing of the app, there are still overlaps between
                user and business.</p>
                <p>02. feature Informed by the features and priorities outlined in my product roadmap, I created an app
                map for Capital One, showing how the new “MoneyWise” feature would integrate within the existing architecture.</p>

            <div id="prototyping">
                <h3>prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    Highlighting two distinct paths Capital One's visual design is fairly simple and my time was limited, I made the
                    decision to go from sketches directly to high-fidelity frames. Existing frames intrgreated with "MoneyWise"
                    feature
                    Non-existing screens to be designed into user flow Moving directly into high fidelity frames, the interaction
                    design
                    also had to be well thought-out before moving forward with prototyping.
                    I included annotations for wire-frames to help
                    document how the new feature would integrate within the existing interface. Annotations: Pre-existing Screens

                <h3>visual design</h3>
                <p>My focus was on adding a new feature to an existing app, not reinventing the existing app. To that end, I adopted all of Capital
                One's existing UI design principles and styles Testing Design validation, I conducted 5 in-person usability tests</p>
