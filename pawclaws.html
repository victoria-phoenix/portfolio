<!-- primary research -->
    <div class="container">
            <h2>Research & Synthesis</h2>
            <p>I began my research for this project with a quick secondary scan of statistics which helped me contextualize the pet
            homelessness situation. My goal here was to understand the current animal rescue industry, specifically, “What is the
            difference between adoption / rescue versus purchasing from a pet store / breeder?” and “What are the repercussions for
            choosing stores over shelters?” Here’s what I learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stat #1: For every puppy or kitten who is deliberately produced by any breeder, an animal in an animal shelter dies.</li>
                    <li>Stat #2: Animal shelters across the nation are forced to stretch their resources to the brink to accommodate an
                    overwhelming population of homeless and at-risk animals.</li>
                    <li>Stat #3: Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those,
                    approximately 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats.</li>
                    <li>Stat #4: Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Competitive Analysis & Provisional Persona</h5>
                <p>With this initial information, I compiled a snapshot of notable pet matching sites currently out for use. A quick search
                for “animal shelters near me” brought to light my top competitors: local animals shelters of various sizes (although
                they are indirect competitors, they are also partners with us) and pet locators that are aggregates of shelters (with
                Petfinder, AdoptAPet, and AllPaws being the most popular). I conducted a quick site audit of my top 5 competitor’s
                website to help identify the strengths and weaknesses of each and surveyed pages for trend and feature implementations
                so to know where best to invest our resources.

<!-- provisional persona -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Provisional Persona </h5>
        <p>In order to facilitate future design decisions, I aggregated and interpreted the data results into provisional personas,
        (relatable, representational customer profiles), focusing heavily on user behavior and motivation. I had created them
        early on to begin thinking about who might make up the customer base of Paws & Claws.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Paws and Claws/Provisional Persona.png" alt="">
    </div>

<!-- contextual inquiry -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Contextual Inquiry</h5>
        <p>Driven by curiosity in learning more about my users, the development of my interview plan was built upon a foundation of
        working assumptions and unknowns. Using my secondary research, unknowns, and assumptions, I developed an interview guide
        to structure my contextual interviews. To understand the procedures for pet adoption, the services and programs offered,
        and the channels and roadblocks for adopting pets, I visited my local rescue shelter. There I struck up conversation
        with 9 individuals (employees and potential adopters) who fell within the aforementioned archetypes and analyzed their
        attitude towards pet adoption.</p>
    </div>

<!-- Empathy Mapping & Persona -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Empathy Mapping & Persona</h5>
        <p>From the contextual inquiry, research data was mapped out and analyzed to identify patterns, similarities, and
        contrasts. By doing so, we uncover insights from my observations and move towards identifying implicit user needs. Based
        on the opinions and views shared by participants, a primary user persona (Sarah) was created to encompass all common
        ideologies between users.</p>

        <h1>Defining And Ideation</h1>
        <h5>POV Statements / HMW Questions</h5>
        <p>With my primary persona established, I moved onto translating the insights and needs of Sarah into defined “Point of
        View” statements. Afterwards, I crafted a set of “How Might We” questions to help ideate the best possible solution for
        each design challenge.</p>

<!-- Brainstorming -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Brainstorming</h5>
        <p>I then posted my HMW questions onto a whiteboard and generated as many ideas as possible, which I planned to review,
            sort, and refine during later stages. Where ever possible, I grouped my ideas by theme and relationship: Organizing
            ideas in this way helped me to expand on some of the ideas further.</p>

        <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
        <h5>Business and User Goals & Feature Roadmap</h5>
        <p>To help define minimal viable product features, I mapped the overlaps of business goals, user goals, and technical
            considerations.
            Image for post
            After a thorough cross examination of my brainstormed ideas with the business user goal map, I created a product
            roadmap, with features presented in order of priority in terms of development and investment. I also included metrics so
            that the impact and effectiveness of the features can be analyzed during testing phases.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
        <h5>Site Mapping & User Flow</h5>
        <p>Using the features furnished in my Product Feature Roadmap, a sitemap was created showing the content architecture
        proposed for Paws & Claws. With the site map in place, I created a user flow based on some simple use cases for Sarah.
        Doing so ensures that the organization of pages flow in a logical and smooth manner. The diagram below outlines 2
        primary tasks Sarah may use during site navigation: 1. Searching, filtering, and reviewing of pet information, and 2.
        Contacting the shelter by filling out an inquiry form.</p>

<!-- Prototyping -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>An interactive mid-fidelity prototype of Paws & Claw’s desktop website was created using Invision. The prototype
        functionality is limited to four major task flows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Task 1: Search the site and filter for a Labrador Retriever, Male, Large, Adult that is good with children, cats, and
                dogs</li>
                <li>Task 2: Switch your residential zip code (60613) to your workplace’s (60645), and search for a compatible dog with the
                same filter criteria as before.</li>
                <li>Task 3: Search the pet profile page for the following information: multiple pictures, pet’s story, appearance, energy,
                health, compatibility, and personality information. Afterwards, send an adoption inquiry and schedule a meet and greet.
                </li>
                <li>Task 4: Search for Alive Rescue Shelter and navigate to Alive Rescue’s info page to view all their pets. Narrow your
                results from all pets to just dogs.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Below is a quick walk through of this mid-fidelity prototype.</p>
    </div>
<!-- Usability Testing & Validation -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Usability Testing & Validation</h5>
        <p>To determine the level of efficiency of design and usability within the user interface of the interactive prototype,
        moderated usability testing was conducted. Due to time constraints, I recruited 3–5 willing participants. The test was
        designed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify features that were successfully implemented in helping users accomplish tasks and uncover features that were
                missing / breaks user expectations / could be improved upon.</li>
                <li>Obtain feedback from users in regards to any obstacles, pain points, or frustrations during site interaction.</li>
                <li>Identify successes and room for improvements in the navigation, information architecture, flow, and design of the site.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </div>
<!-- Affinity Charts -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Affinity Charts</h5>
        <p>An affinity map was created based on errors and issues observed during usability testing. I segregated data into 3
        groups of findings: successes, challenges, and observations to distill insights. From there, I translated my insights
        into a recommended course of action to address our user’s issues.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Paws and Claws/Affinity Mapping.png" alt="">
    </div>
    
<!-- User Interface Design -->
<div class="container">
    <h1>User Interface Design</h1>
    <h5>Mood Board</h5>
    <p>The prototype was further updated to accommodate the affinity map recommendations. During this iterative stage, I also
    developed the site’s visual design, first creating a mood board to draw inspiration for my color palette, imagery, logo,
    branding, type-faces, and icons.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Paws and Claws/Mood Board.png" alt="">
    <p>Although pet adoption is a rather serious and heart-wrenching topic, I wanted users to be greeted with an air of
    positivism and professionalism. Users should feel warm and optimistic about the opportunity to add a new member to their
    family, and the site should be reflective of that.</p>
    <p>Given the over-population of blacks, browns, grays, and whites from pet coats, I ended up going for a mid-century theme
    with blue and orange accent colors to add a pop of vibrancy from the rather neutral focus colors.</p>

            <h5>Logo Design</h5>
            <p>My logo is a graphical representation of the name itself: I wanted the logo to be representative of the site’s mission,
            and believed the best direction would be to incorporate imagery of a dog and cat. I went for a silhouette with a play on
            positive and negative space to conserve real estate on the site’s navigation area. Final Logo Design. Influenced by the following central characteristics: bold and vibrant (but not childish), optimistic
            and welcoming, friendly and caring, professional and trustworthy, clean and minimal

            <h5>Style Tile & UI Kit</h5>
            <p>I then created a style tile by compiling the elements from my mood-board, logo, and additional visual elements. This
            served as a guide for when I applied the visual design to my final high-fidelity wire-frames. I had also created a UI
            Kit to serve as a reference for anyone working on the site. Should any additional iterations / add ons / changes need to
            be made in the future, having this guide will ensure consistency of styles and elements across all screens.</p>

        <p>The overall findings were quite successful given the time constraints on this project. Now that we have corrected for
        round 1 issues, during next stages, I would like to move forward with implementation of priority 2 (educational resource
        screens) and priority 3 (community / social) features. I’m most excited for the design and development of a community
        forum, as the organization of content and information architecture would likely be a fun challenge.</p>
