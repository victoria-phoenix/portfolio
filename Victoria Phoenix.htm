    <h1>Google Aria</h1>
    <p>At the forefront of health-tech, Google has invested in wearable devices designed to track patient's vitals. With the
    aggregated data, we've set out to design a mobile app (to be used in conjunction with wearable patches) for asthma, an
    ailment that afflicts about 25 millions American&nbsp;today.</p>

    <h2>the technology</h2>
    <p>Aria is a combination wearable + mobile app solution to asthma management. Data aggregates from the wearable patch into
    a mobile application so to display vital information to asthmatic users in a succinct and user friendly manner.</p>
    <strong>wearable tracking capabilities:</strong>
    heart-rate
    wheezing + coughing
    respiration
    exercise
    <strong>companion app</strong>
    goal: build out mobile interface

    open conversation
    participant seeking
    With the tight timeframe, there was only 1 try to obtain the insights needed to design out our app. To circumvent
    ill-preparedness, we continually referenced levels of hierarchical empathy to help draw out unadulterated insights
    throughout our research.

User reply on mental recall when relaying information to health professionals when when they ask for detailed accounts
of symptoms, triggers, and exacerbation
Users sometimes forget to take their medication
Most common triggers are those related to air quality, including poor weather air pollution, and allergens
From a round of ideation and white-boarding, we fleshed out ideas and cross-compared according to business and user
needs, as well as costs.
many ideas, too little time.
goal #2: implement cutoffs
in an effort to prevent feature creep, features were in relation to the results of a conducted competitive analysis&nbsp;


With features set in place, we mapped the architecture and fleshed out the layout via iterative rounds of low level
sketches before moving forward with the time-consuming high level prototype.&nbsp;


The visual design of Aria complies with standard material design guidelines.
The design proved to be overall intuitive, with just a few kinks to be smoothed down during my second design iteration.
