            <h1>in-store vs. online shopping<br></h1>
            <p>Key Insight #1: There still remains a fairly equal split between shopping in physical stores vs. online retailers.
            55% of online shoppers would prefer to buy from a merchant with a physical store presence over an online-only retailer.
            51% of Americans think shopping online is the best way to shop, with 49% preferring shopping in-store.
            Key Insight #2
            With information right at our fingertips, shoppers are more fickle with their brands than ever before.
            72% of young shoppers research online before purchasing in a store.
            With millennials, "89% of mobile users say they search the web while shopping."
            market research confirms unified channel strategies (online + physical) to be most practical and suggests a
            "best-of-both worlds" approach.

            <p>Figure 3: mapped out user interview responses into 4 quadrants (doing and saying, thinking and feeling, seeing, and
            hearing) to more deeply understand our user's experiences.</p>
            <p>...which informed online interviewee selection (As anticipated, research deadlines loomed , so we opted
                for online interviews.)</p>

            Proving & Disapproving Assumptions
            Customers know what they want & roughly how much it should cost
            1 user knew exactly what he wanted when purchasing clothes online, 3 users typically browse for sale items / do searches
            and filters, oftentimes skeptical of purchases because they can't see it in person.
            Shoppers will be more stringent when shopping online, expecting prices to be cheaper versus in store
            True, from price comparisons to looking for free shipping options to only shopping at sales areas, all 4 users were more
            stringent shopping online.
            Online shopping is more a personalized experience versus in-store
            Inconclusive, however, users def. want more suggestive features, with 3 of 4 stating it would make their experience more
            pleasant.
            Uncovering Unknowns
            What motivates a customer to purchase clothes online as opposed to in store?
            Multiple factors, however, all 4 users have talked about the following:
            Comparative shopping allows for cheaper price
            Lack of time to shop in store
            Not having to deal with poor customer service
            Lack of conveniency shopping in stores - overwhelming, crowded and poorly categorized
            Time consuming process of waiting for checklist / fitting rooms
            What are their typical shopping processes from product searching to product purchasing?
            Email Updates -> Browse -> Cart & Contemplate -> Purchase -> Try On -> Keep Good, Return Bad
            Straight to sales catalog -> filter and sort to specifications -> Cart and purchase
            Navigate menu categories and uses sorts (low to high prices) -> cart and contemplate -> purchase
            Offline and then online, but only if absolutely necessary. (Eg. can't find right size in store).
