                <h2>In-store vs. online shopping</h2>
                <p>With strong desire to optimize Mirror’s online retail strategy, I extensively explored e-commerce trends during my
                initial research phase. Knowing full well that the fashion industry is an over-saturated market, success or failure
                hinges on our ability to jump aboard the latest shopping trends as they crest. Market trend analysis garnered the
                following major takeaways:</p>

            <div class="container col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-6">
                <p><strong>Key Insight #1: There still remains a fairly equal split between shopping in physical stores vs. online retailers.</strong></p>
                <p>55% of online shoppers would prefer to buy from a merchant with a physical store presence over an online-only retailer.</p>
                <p>51% of Americans think shopping online is the best way to shop, with 49% preferring shopping in-store.</p>

            <div class="container col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-6">

                <p>72% of young shoppers research online before purchasing in a store.</p>
                <p>With millennials, “89% of mobile users say they search the web while shopping.”</p>

                <p>With this initial information, I focused on uncovering existing yet obscure user expectations, behaviors, and
                perceptions in the fashion space. I compiled an e-commerce snapshot of notable fast fashion retailers (both competing
                and analogous), and surveyed for trend implementations, areas of success + failure, and user expectations — so to know
                where best to invest our resources. In order to facilitate future design decisions, I aggregated and interpreted the
                data results into provisional personas, relatable, representational customer profiles (archetypes), focusing heavily on
                user behavior and motivation.</p>

                <p>“One must first assume something to discover something.” Driven by curiosity in learning more about my users, the
                development of my interview questions was built upon a foundation of working assumptions and unknowns. To better
                understand online shoppers and to test my assumptions, I conducted 4 user interviews with participants who fell within
                the aforementioned archetypes. I recruited 4 individuals to speak with in-person (2 male, 2 female, within the age range
                of 18–50, employed, who have shopped online within the past 6 months.) These participants were asked about their
                shopping habits and preferences. They were also asked to walk me through the process of browsing for an article of
                clothing using a store of their choice.</p>

        <p>While the supply amount of data garnered during discovery was substantial, I was able to surmount difficulties through
            various information defining techniques. Exploring information in a visual way makes it easier to spot behavioral
            patterns and to synthesize user needs.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Empathy Mapping.png" alt="">
        <p>Empathy mapping summed up our learning from user engagements and synthesized insights from our observed user’s needs.
        From it, we discovered strong desire for personal and social integrations in the online space.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Persona.png" alt="">
        <p>My empathy map functioned as a backbone for persona construction. From the composite of my research findings emerged
        Jamie. Due to professional obligations, time is a limited resource. Thus, she values a quick, efficient shopping
        experience so that time can be allotted elsewhere — spending more time with family and friends.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Storyboarding.png" alt="">
        <p>Storyboarding captured my user’s emotional evolution as he / she goes about shopping for articles of clothing. By
        illustrating a potential key path scenario, we understand how Mirror fits into our user’s daily lives when needs are
        triggered.</p>

                look for, and all found it frustrating to predict the quality and fit of garments.</li>
                <li>All users care about shipping and returns, favoring stores that offer leniency and or offer free returns and free

                <li>All users agree (even exclusive in store shoppers) that shopping online saves time, provides a wider selection of
                clothes, and is oftentimes cheaper, as opposed to shopping in person.</li>
                <li>All users expect intuitive and personalized features that help to quickly narrow down options as they browse.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What Surprised Me</strong></p>
            <p>While market analysis research asserts mobile shopping to be on the rise, interviewed users preferred completing

    <h1>Defining And Ideation</h1>
    <h5>POV Statements / HMW Questions</h5>
    <p>Amalgamated data from our visualization techniques reveals a composite user (Jamie) who desires to maximize on
    information searching avenues, Eg. lessen the overall time spent shopping for an exact item mid a pool of options, while
    also being able to minimize on the risk(s) of receiving an inadequate product. Ill-fitting garments, non-comprehensive
    product descriptions, and costly (in both time and money) return processes appear to be huge areas of frustration.</p>
    <p>This compounded insight informed the HMW Question, crafted to guide my design:</p>
    <p class="lead">“How might we organize, structure, and label Mirror’s content so that Jamie can quickly find and purchase clothing that
    she is searching for, all while feeling confident about her selections?”</p>

<!-- Product Strategy -->

    <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
    <h5>Business And User Goals</h5>
    <p>Prior to design, I shaped the direction of my product via a clear strategy. Wanting the outcome to be customer and
    market-driven, I defined the high-level business objectives and key customer attributes necessary to achieve success.
    Identifying overlaps within Jamie’s and Mirror’s goals (while mindful of technical considerations) defined the inclusive
    features that benefit desires from both parties. It also informed the entire brand experience — from messaging to
    imagery to site content.</p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Business User Goals.png" alt="">
    
    <h5>Feature Roadmap</h5>

            <p>To understand how users perceive product categories, an open-ended card sort (online with 10 participants) was
                conducted. A set of 30 clothing items were provided to participants and they were asked to group them. Results
                confirmed
                user expectations to be strongly influenced by existing fast fashion site patterns, which then helped to inform the

        linear tasks, and how users journey to checkout via different entry points and paths. Constructing these flows
        ultimately informs the creation of what key pages and features to design for user testing.</p>

    <p>Before moving to digital wire-frames, I quickly conceptualized layouts using trusty pen and paper. I wanted to map out
    the site information in a simple intuitive way that satisfied both business and user needs, thus, I drew inspiration from popular fashion retailers and examined design patterns from each site. I settled on version 1 sketch (middle) as it proved to be the most modern and intuitive design. With my choice set, I moved on to building mid and high fidelity wire-frames of responsive key pages that meet my primary user flow.</p>

    <h5>Mood Board</h5>
    <p>Informed by my user research, I had set out to develop a longstanding brand that is on par with rival fashion sites. The
    name itself — Mirror, primed my aesthetic vision. I found much inspiration in the form of “mirror images.” From those images, surfaced 4 central site characteristics.
    Modern and Simple
    Transparent and Trustworthy
    Sleek and Stylish
    Diverse … with just a hint of playfulness
    (to keep the layout from seeming too sterile.)</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Mood Board.png" alt="">


    <h5>Logo Design</h5>
    <p>The logo is a reflective word-play of the name itself. While I had explored innumerable ideas on the concept of
        reflection, one design rose above the rest in its distinction, simplicity, and modernity. The coral pink hue and the
        boldness from the logo’s font perfectly counterbalanced the daintiness of the rest of the site, aiding in a sense of
        playfulness.

    <h5 class="mt-3">Style Tile & UI Kit</h5>
    <p>I opted for a vibrant palette, filled with shades and tints of coral-pink, bluish-teal, grey-black, and white-grey. Bold
    hues were used sparingly, only to draw attention to important elements, whilst blue, white, and grey were strategically
    picked to represent the fresh reflective colors associated with mirrors. Tastefully positioning elements while leaving
    just the right amount of white space in between helped to organize layout in a clean, uncluttered way.
    </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Style Tile.png" alt="">

    <p>My style-tile is a “snippet” representation of my brand vision for Mirror, which of course, ultimately informed the site
    design. When final high fidelity frames were completed, I aggregated all the design elements and housed them in a UI Kit
    so that designers and developer can refer to them during future stages of iteration.

<!-- Prototyping -->

        <h1>Prototyping</h1>
        <p>I then brought all my high fidelity frames and key elements into Invision to prepare for usability testing.
        Unfortunately, this prototype had been archived. Below is a video recording of a user (Elizabeth) running through all
        major task flows. Audio has been removed, as I do not have Elizabeth’s permission to share with the public.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Task # 1: Shop for a women’s, size 4, white blouse, and add it to your shopping bag. Then view your shopping bag to ensure item details are correct.</li>
            <li>Task # 2: After adding your blouse to the shopping cart, stay on the blouse product page. From there, shop for a blue,
            Matt & Nat clutch, and add to the wish list for contemplation.</li>
            <li>Task # 3: Navigate to your wish list, edit the clutch color from blue to white, and add the clutch to your shopping bag.
            From your shopping bag, checkout your purchase.</li>
        </ul>

<!-- Usability Testing -->
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="mt-5">Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>In order to validate my solution, I spent the afternoon at a coffee shop filled with millennials with 4 major testing
        goals in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Observe and note pain points, areas of uncertainty, and/or dissatisfaction with any missing features</li>
            <li>(In)validate key assumptions</li>
            <li>Assess the usability and functionality of Mirror’s navigation, hierarchy, and information architecture.</li>
            <li>Discover which path is preferred if there are multiple ways for accomplishing a particular tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5 participants (3 male, 2 female) were recruited. All participants were asked to walk through the prototype, performing
        the 3 aforementioned tasks flows.</p>
    </div>

<!-- Affinity Charts -->
    <div class="container">
        <h5>Affinity Mapping</h5>
        <p>Using an affinity map, we methodically organized interview responses to obtain insights and suggestions for improvement
        including which features should be given priority over others during stages of re-design.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Mirror/Affinity Mapping.png" alt="">
            
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                    <strong>Test Completion:</strong>
                    <p>Findings suggest that users expect certain conventions in terms of information architecture. Most of these
                        conventions
                        had been followed through on my first implementation, and therefore, led to fairly successful test results.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-6">
                    <strong>Task Flow:</strong>
                    <p>What surprised me most was the overwhelming amount of users who preferred navigation over search bar to find their
                        product of choice. All participants expressed that the search-bar would be fruitless (and an inefficient management
                        of
                        time) without an exact description of the desired item.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-6">
                    <strong>Pain Points:</strong>
                    <p>While the navigation throughout the buying, wish-listing, and carting process proved to be successful and the image
                        driven content impressed users, there were still some points of friction that we need to address in our design.
                        Surface
                        level improvements in font size and elemental hierarchy can be made, including upping the font size of particular
                        links
                        for easier visibility, rethinking the labeling of “wishlist editing,” and revising the hierarchical placement of
                        social
                        media icons.</p>
                </div>

<!-- Final High Fidelity Prototype -->
    <div class="container my-5">
        <h2>Final High Fidelity Prototype</h2>
        <p>Corrections have been integrated with a second iteration, alongside a change in color scheme (albeit unnecessary as the
        color scheme would change according to the types of products offered), as some male users preferred a more gender
        neutral palette — confirmed during usability testing.</p>

<!-- Takeaways -->
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
        <p>Leveraging existing design patterns and user expectations within the e-commerce space allowed for me to build upon the
        successes and failures of others. By doing so there’s the added benefit of:
        minimal effort, cost-effective improvements for tried problems, and
        efficiency, which enables us to invest our resources elsewhere — to explore newer avenues of information searching and
        alternative risk minimization features so that we can be distinguished from the rather massive fashion world.
        With efficiency as an added benefit, our next steps should focus on innovative, rising e-commerce trends (Eg. virtual
        fitting room). Doing so will help distinguish and place Mirror at a competitive advantage.</p>
