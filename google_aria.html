    <h1>Google Aria</h1>
    <p>At the forefront of health-tech, Google has invested in wearable devices designed to track patient's vitals. With
        the aggregated data, we've set out to design a mobile app (to be used in conjunction with wearable patches) for
        asthma, an ailment that afflicts about 25 millions American today.</p>

    <h2>the technology</h2>
    <p>Aria is a combination wearable + mobile app solution to asthma management. Data aggregates from the wearable patch into a mobile application so to display vital information to asthmatic users in a succinct and user friendly manner. <strong>wearable tracking capabilities:</strong>
    heart-rate wheezing + coughing respiration exercise <strong>companion app</strong> goal: build out mobile interface</p>

    <h2>the project timeline</h2>
    <p>A 2 week design scope posed limitations, and we foresaw 2 potential challenges within the research phase of our product lifecycle: 
        <ol>
            <li>open conversation</li>
            <li>participant seeking</li>
        </ol>
        With the tight timeframe, there was only 1 try to obtain the insights needed to design out our app. To
        circumvent ill-preparedness, we continually referenced levels of hierarchical empathy to help draw out unadulterated
        insights throughout our research.

    <p>
        From a round of ideation and white-boarding, we fleshed out ideas and cross-compared according to business and
        user
        needs, as well as costs.
        many ideas, too little time.

    <h2>goal #2: implement cutoffs</h2>

    <h1><br></h1>
    <p>With features set in place, we mapped the architecture and fleshed out the layout via iterative rounds of low

        sketches before moving forward with the time-consuming high level prototype. </p>
