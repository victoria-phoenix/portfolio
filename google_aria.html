                <h5>The technology</h5>
                <p>Aria is a combination wearable + mobile app solution to asthma management. Data aggregates from the wearable patch
                    into a mobile application so to display vital information to asthmatic users in a succinct and user friendly manner.
                    Wearable tracking capabilities include heart-rate, wheezing + coughing, respiration, and exercise. Our goal is to
                    build out the mobile interface for the companion app.</p>

                <h2>The Project Timeline</h2>
                <p>A 2 week design scope posed limitations, and we foresaw 2 potential challenges within the research phase of our product
                lifecycle:

                        <li>open conversation</li>

                </p>
                <p>With the tight timeframe, there was only 1 try to obtain the insights needed to design out our app. To circumvent
                    ill-preparedness, we continually referenced levels of hierarchical empathy to help draw out unadulterated insights
                    throughout our research.

                <p>As my knowledge within the realms of asthma management was currently insufficient, I crafted a research strategy to
                bridge my knowledge gap. From a quick mind-mapping session packed with assumptions and questions, I organized my
                ignorance into, but not limited to, 4 areas of needed clarification: triggers / management / severity / physiology &
                pathology, which we later debunked during desk research.</p>

                bountiful amount of indirect players — 38 to be exact. Chopping this list down to more manageable total of 5 (based on
                the ratings, features, and functions that most closely meet the high level objectives of this project) reveals commonality of features: trigger tracking, trend information, emergency support, and medication tracking being the most ubiquitous.</p>

        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <h5>Honing In On Target Users</h5>
        <p>Persona hypothesis consisted of three different early stage archetypes which was used to facilitate discussions about
        our users. "The Asthmatic" was prioritized for the initial buildout of a minimal viable product, as we wanted to first
        design for the needs, desires, and varying contexts of those who experience asthma rather than for secondary characters
        who interact with but do not have. This provisional persona was used to prospect and secure a total of 6 asthmatic patients within the target market to collect data about their opinions, preferences, habits, and pain points regarding asthma.</p>

<!-- Empathy Mapping -->
    <div class="container mt-3">
        <h5>Empathy Mapping</h5>
        <p>Findings mapped from my interviews to 1. help empathize observations
        from the research phase, 2. draw out unexpected insights about our user’s needs, and 3. to sum up our learning from user
        engagements.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h5>Aria would be most beneficial for those with moderate asthma.</h5>
        <p>Online interviewee responses refined our archetype further. Research findings indicate that designing an asthma
            application will not be completely beneficial for all asthma patients. Different patients have different levels of
            asthmatic severity and the usage of management tools is dependent on such: Those with acute asthma express less
            concern / need for trigger, medication, and symptom documentation. Those with severe deem it unnecessary because
            they have had asthma for many years and are already confident in their self-management techniques.</p>

        interviews and secondary research data.</p>

                <td>Most common triggers are those related to air quality, including poor weather air pollution, and allergens

<!-- Defining + Ideation -->
    <div class="container my-5">
        <h1>Defining And Ideation</h1>
        <p>Based on the needs of Daisy, I came up with POV Statements that then led to the creation of action-oriented HMW
        Questions. Doing so helps to establish a minimal viable product by ideating the best possible solution(s) for each
        design challenge.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Google Aria/HMW Statement.png" alt="">
        <p>With the HMW Questions, I came up with potential solutions for the problems at hand and quickly mapped
        them out via an hour long brainstorm session.</p>

<!-- Product Strategy -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
        <h5>Business And User Goals</h5>
        <p> Before moving into interaction design, I needed to ruminate for user and business needs and determine middle ground
            goals that satisfy both stakeholders and potential users. To help define the functionality of the MVP features, I cross-examined each
            brainstormed idea with our business user goal map, which ultimately helps to determine which idea(s) from my
            brainstorming might best serve the needs of our stakeholders.</p>

        <h5>Implement cutoffs</h5>
        <p>Many ideas, Too little time. In an effort to prioritize the features derived from my product strategy, I outlined details for each and ranked them in accordance to levels of time and resource investment.</p>

        <h5>User Flow</h5>
        <p>A user flow map provided insight into Daisy’s expectations when using the asthma app: It helps empathize with how she
        would navigate pages to complete linear tasks, and how she would journey to checkout via different entry points and
        paths. Constructing the user flow ultimately informed what key pages and features to design for during user testing.</p>

<!-- Interaction Design -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Interaction Design</h1>
        <h5>Sketches + Mockups</h5>
        <p>I fleshed out the layout via iterative rounds of disposable low level sketches before moving forward with the time-consuming high level prototype. 
            At each stage of design, I tried to ensure that the copy and interface was simple enough for the user to comprehend. I wanted task flow interactions to be quick so that users would not be frustrated with time-consuming processes, a pain point of which had been expressed during empathy
        research.</p>

        <p>Distillation of usability testing results show that users had the most issues when running through task flows 1 and 3.
            Specifically, users had difficulty finding the medication section and were confused when asked to find trend information
            for specific vitals. By re-framing these problems into more “how might we” questions, we enter another round of
            brainstorming. Solutions that best resolve problems are then charted and prioritized within a list of recommendations.</p>

        <strong>Observation Patterns</strong>
        <p>While the design was fairly successful in terms of flows, participants found relationships between words and meaning to
            be rather tricky, and thus, had trouble determining the appropriate course of action from vague links such as “more
            details.”</p>

        <strong>Prioritized Recommendations</strong>
        <p>Changes are prioritized from high to low based on amount of users who are frustrated with each specific issue.</p>

<!-- Usability Testing Takeaways-->
    <div class="container my-5">
        <h5>Usability Testing Takeaways</h5>
        <p><mark class="lead">100% completion rate <br> 84.75% error free rate <br> </mark>The design proved to be overall
            intuitive, with just a few kinks to be smoothed down during my second design
            iteration.</p>
    
        <strong>1. Finding the medication section was a concern => How can we make searchability of medication section easier for
            users?</strong >
        <p>There remains an equal balance between users who search for information via homecreen and navigation: Include
            header within home display. Add medication tab within navigation.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Google Aria/medication.png" alt="">
    
        <strong>2. More details link too vague for users to understand function => How can we make viewing of specific trend
        information less confusing?</strong>
        <p>Rephrasing vague "more details" into specific actions: "view all (insert specific vital) stats" or "view all
            (insert specific vital) trends."</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="Project Deliverables/Google Aria/More details link.png" alt="">
    
        <strong>3. Expectation of an event log section => How can we help users to visually see the amount of asthma
        attacks / incidences within a certain period of time?</strong>
        <p>House an event log snippet section within the home screen by redesigning the non-intuitive "recent activities"
            section into a functional event log section. Incorporate status cards for quick information intake.</p>

        <h1>User Interface Design</h1>
        <p>To accommodate the changes rolled out from usability testing, the prototype was iterated into a high-fidelity version.
        Aria’s visual design complies with standard material design guidelines alongside the following attribute requirements:</p>
        <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table table-sm">
                <td>clean, clear, fresh <br>

                    reliable
                </td>
                <td>imagery inspired by simple, flat style illustrations typically seen on existing Google apps</td>
                <td>vibrant colors to draw attention to specific elements - chart and graphs shown within the dashboard </td>
                <td>Primary blue color palette with minimal white background to reflect concept of air + asthma, as well as
                    aforementioned attributes: clean,fresh, and clear </td>
